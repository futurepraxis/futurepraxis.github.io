For this project, I worked collaboratively with the Northwestern Law Marketing and Communications team to help redesign [Northwestern Law's Alumni Portal](http://www.law.northwestern.edu/alumni/) in order to make it easier for users to navigate the different resources available on the law school's large site.

**Graphic Design:** Mary Kate Strittmatter
**HTML/CSS Design:** Natalie Roman
