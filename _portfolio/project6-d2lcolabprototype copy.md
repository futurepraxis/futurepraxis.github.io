[D2L coLab Responsive Prototype](https://jcmelh.axshare.com) was completed for HCI 430: Prototyping and Implementation at DePaul University.

For this project, we were challenged with creating a responsive prototype in Axure for web, tablet, and mobile experiences. I chose to prototype a responsive calendar for D2L coLab, an application that my group is designing in class.

D2L coLab is a plugin that adds more collabortive functionality to the Desire To Learn (D2L) learning-management system, to allow both online and in-class students to work on group projects together. 

I created this prototype for the calendar to show how students would be able to see their teammate's availability so that they can easily schedule meetings and keep track of assignment due dates for all of their classes. [View the full prototype.](https://jcmelh.axshare.com)
